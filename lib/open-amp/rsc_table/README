Description:

In addition to the standard ELF segments, most remote processors would
also include a special section which we call "the resource table".

The resource table contains system resources that the remote processor
requires before it should be powered on, such as allocation of physically
contiguous memory, or iommu mapping of certain on-chip peripherals.

In addition to system resources, the resource table may also contain
resource entries that publish the existence of supported features
or configurations by the remote processor, such as trace buffers and
supported virtio devices (and their configurations).

Dependencies:
  to be compliant with Linux kernel OS the resource table must be linked in a
  specific section named ".resource_table".
